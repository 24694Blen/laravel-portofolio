                Who is Blen Michil?
            </h1>
            <p class="aboutme__text--p">
                My name is Blen Michil and I am 18 years old, born in the Netherlands on July 28, 2001.
                My mother works for a business travel organization in Alkmaar and my father has his own gym in
                Amsterdam.
                At the moment I am following the Media Developer course at Media College Amsterdam. Completed my 2nd
                grade successfully in July this year.
                <br>
                <br>
                I chose this course because I find it very interesting to program (work with codes) and maintain
                (mobile) websites, apps and web applications. In addition, I not only learn a lot about technology and
                programming, but also about the basics of digital design. My interest in this direction has come because
                my uncle is also a developer. I have already seen a lot of his work and that fascinates me enormously.
                My strongest side is now Front-End, I was able to gain some experience during my last internship with
                HTML and CSS, but my javascript will be a bit better. In my first year, we mainly focused on Front-End
                skills. I also want to develop myself further in the field of Back-End. I know the basics of PHP and
                just started with Laravel and Java. I hope I can learn more with you.
